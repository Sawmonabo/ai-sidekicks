/**
 * How long a human's composing indicator survives without a refresh, in
 * milliseconds.
 *
 * The receive half of the bound `Spec-023 §Console Design (Meridian)`'s
 * collaboration section states. It sits well inside the thirty-second Awareness
 * staleness window, so an indicator is gone from the screen long before the
 * protocol would garbage-collect the client that wrote it.
 *
 * A receiver that clears at ten seconds is only correct while a still-composing
 * sender refreshes inside that window, so moving this one moves what a publisher
 * owes.
