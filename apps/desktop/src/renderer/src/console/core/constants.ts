// The console's named bounds. All of them.
//
// `Spec-023 §Console Design (Meridian)` §The four bars, "Light on the machine":
// "Every cap, window, and timeout is a named constant with a one-line rationale".
// `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md` says where: "One value, one home: budgets and their unit
// factors in `budgets.json`, caps in `console/core/constants.ts` with a rationale
// each."
//
// ONE HOME MEANS ONE HOME. This file used to say a view family adds its own module
// beside its subtree, and four families took that licence — `agents/constants.ts`,
// `collaboration/constants.ts`, `sessions/bounds.ts`, `settings/constants.ts` — so a
// cap audit's answer depended on which of five places it looked in, and a bound was
// spelled `constants` in three of them and `bounds` in the fourth. Every bound lives
// here now, and `test/console/architecture/cap-single-home.test.ts` fails the build
// if a second home appears.
//
// GROUPED BY WHO SPENDS IT, banner-commented, appended within a group. The rationale
// travels with the value: a bound moved here without the paragraph that says why it
// is that number is a number, and a number is what this file exists to prevent.
// `core/` is the bottom of the family DAG, so every family may import from it and no
// family crosses another to reach a bound.
//
// A number that appears inline anywhere under `console/` and is not a layout
// literal is a review rejection: the rationale is the point, not the constant.
