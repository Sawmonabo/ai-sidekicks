/**
 * A writable run's branch context, as `Spec-011 §Interfaces And Contracts`
 * requires the read to expose it — base, head, upstream, and worktree association.
 *
 * The three optional members are optional on the wire for structural reasons, not
 * for convenience, and the reasons are worth carrying: `upstreamRef` is absent
 * until the head branch has one, and `worktreeId` / `ephemeralCloneId` are present
 * only on the anchoring their context actually has (`branch_contexts` carries an
 * at-most-one association CHECK). A required member here would force a producer to
 * supply a value for an anchoring the context does not have, and the only value it
 * could supply is a fabrication.
