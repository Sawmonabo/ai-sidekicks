// The bridge door.
//
// Everything the console reaches the outside world through: the `ConsoleBridge`
// contract, the two implementations (live preload, `define`-gated fixture), the
// provider and hooks that resolve one of them exactly once at mount, the growth
// port that refuses every wire the console does not yet have, and the ledger that
// makes those refusals checkable against `Plan-023 §Console growth slate`.
//
// WHY THE GROWTH LEDGER IS PART OF THIS DOOR. The console is built against wires
// that do not exist, and the honest way to do that is a port whose every operation
// refuses by name plus a manifest that says which slate row each refusal serves.
// A surface consuming `GrowthPort` and a test auditing the ledger are reading one
// vocabulary; splitting them across two doors would let the port grow an operation
// the ledger never heard of, which is precisely what I-023-13 exists to catch.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. `scenarios/index.ts` is the seat board six concurrent family
// branches each add one line to, and it is reached through `scenario-manifest.js`
// rather than re-exported here, so a family editing its own seat never touches
// this file.

// The one answer to "which clock does this window run on". Exported because the
// two composition roots that build a clocked subsystem — the session registry and
// the durable UI-state store — both ask it, and two readings of the bridge's
// engine would be two clocks the moment one of them forgot the fixture arm.
export { consoleClockFor } from "./console-bridge.js";

// The subscribe seam's own vocabulary. Exported because the binder one family up
// passes it to `daemon.subscribe` and the fixture answers it — two sides of one
// seam reading one declaration rather than two spellings of one string. The two
// `run.*` stream NAMES beside it in that table are still not re-exported: their
// consumers so far are in this family, which reaches them directly, and a barrel
// specifier no cross-family import uses is a dead export rather than a convenience.

// one family up checks a durable payload's `newState` against it before storing a

// console would hold two answers to which state a kind announces and the fold
// would be measured against the wrong one.

// read over it and every surface that offers sessions reads the directory through
// it, so the port type, the one summary shape those surfaces render, the refusal
// they render instead, and the builder that mints one all leave through this door —
// the same door the bridge itself does, because a growth refusal IS what this bridge
// answers for a wire the corpus has not registered.
// `GrowthSessionSummary` leaves through the module that DECLARES it, never through
// `growth-values/index.js`. That inner barrel is the bridge's own sub-module door,
// reached deep by the three modules inside this family that read several planes at
// once; forwarding a name through it from here would chain one barrel into another,
// which `console-no-barrel-chain` now fails and which makes a symbol's home a matter
// of following two hops instead of reading one specifier.

// only caller is the provider beside it, and its only reader is a driver in
