// The bridge door.
//
// Everything the console reaches the outside world through: the `ConsoleBridge`
// contract, the two implementations (live preload, `define`-gated fixture), the
// provider and hooks that resolve one of them exactly once at mount, the growth
// port that refuses every wire the console does not yet have, and the ledger that
// makes those refusals checkable against `Plan-023 §Console growth slate`.
//
// WHY THE GROWTH LEDGER IS PART OF THIS DOOR. The console is built against wires
// that do not exist, and the honest way to do that is a port whose every operation
// refuses by name plus a manifest that says which slate row each refusal serves.
// A surface consuming `GrowthPort` and a test auditing the ledger are reading one
// vocabulary; splitting them across two doors would let the port grow an operation
// the ledger never heard of, which is precisely what I-023-13 exists to catch.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. `scenarios/index.ts` is the seat board six concurrent family
// branches each add one line to, and it is reached through `scenario-manifest.js`
// rather than re-exported here, so a family editing its own seat never touches
// this file.

// The one answer to "which clock does this window run on". Exported because the

// the durable UI-state store — both ask it, and two readings of the bridge's
// engine would be two clocks the moment one of them forgot the fixture arm.

// The subscribe seam's own vocabulary. Exported because the binder one family up
// passes it to `daemon.subscribe` and the fixture answers it — two sides of one
// seam reading one declaration rather than two spellings of one string. The two
// `run.*` stream NAMES beside it in that table are still not re-exported: their
