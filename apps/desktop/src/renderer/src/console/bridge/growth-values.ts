// The named values growth-port replies are made of.
//
// One interface per shape a served operation answers with, plus the one closed
// vocabulary those shapes read from. They are the CONSOLE's, derived from what its
// surfaces render — not a claim about the eventual wire shape, which belongs to the
// document named on the operation's slate row.
//
// WHY THEY ARE NOT IN THE SIGNATURE TABLE. Most request and reply shapes ARE stated
// inline next door in `growth-signatures.ts`, and that is the default: a shape read
// once at one call site earns no name. A shape lands here when it has a second
// reader — `GrowthSessionSummary` is one the fixture port constructs and the family
// barrel publishes — or when naming it is what lets two operations answer with the
// same thing rather than two spellings of it. The table then reads as a table.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Shapes that carry their own vocabulary AND several members,
// which take a module each on the `attention-projection.ts` precedent and state a
// deletion obligation there. The line is drawn where it stops being a value and
// starts being a domain.
