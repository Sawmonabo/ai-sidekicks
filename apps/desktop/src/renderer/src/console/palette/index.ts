// The palette subtree's public surface.
//
// One door, whatever the module count behind it. The frame mounts
// `PaletteOverlay`, contributes commands through `CommandRegistry`, and installs
// chords through `KeyBindingTable`.
// Settings search and the sidebar filter reach past none of that — they import
// `scoreSubsequence` directly, which is what "one matcher shared with settings
// search" (`Spec-023 §Console Design (Meridian)` §Layout grammar) means in code.
//
// A door forwards only what its own family owns. How a chord is PRINTED is
// `primitives/chord-format.ts`, and a caller that wants it imports it from
// `primitives/index.js` — re-exporting it here would make this family look like the
// owner of a table it consumes, and the next reader would put the next chord
// concern in the wrong place.
//
// The stylesheet is imported HERE and not from `PaletteOverlay.tsx`, so every
// family's CSS arrives through that family's one door. A component importing its
// own sheet works until a second component in the family needs it, at which point
// the sheet's presence depends on which component the bundler reached first.
