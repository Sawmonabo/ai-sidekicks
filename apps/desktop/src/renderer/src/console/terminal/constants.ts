// The terminal family's named bounds.
//
// `console/core/constants.ts` states the shape this obeys: it is the substrate's
// own home for bounds, and "each view family adds its own module beside its
// subtree rather than widening this one, so a bound always sits next to the code
// that spends it". This is that module for `terminal/`.
//
// The three below are spent by three different files in this family, which is why
// they are collected rather than declared where they are read: two are also read
// by a test tier that must not construct an emulator to learn a number.
