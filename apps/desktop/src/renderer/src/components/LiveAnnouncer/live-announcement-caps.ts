/**
 * Announcements the live announcer holds in ONE politeness lane while an earlier
 * one is still standing in its region.
 *
 * A screen reader speaks one message at a time, so announcements are serialised
 * rather than overwritten — an overwrite inside the hold window below is a message
 * nobody heard. Past this bound the burst is one condition repeating rather than
 * this many separate things a person needs told, so the OLDEST is dropped: the
 * newest fact is the one still true, and a queue that shed the newest would spend
 * its whole drain reading history. The bound is per lane rather than shared,
 * because the two lanes are two independent speech channels and a burst of polite
 * announcements must not be able to shed a refusal.

/**
 * How long one announcement stays in its region before the announcer clears it
 * and publishes whatever is queued behind it.
 *
 * Two things fix this window, and they pull in opposite directions. It has to be
 * long enough that assistive technology observes the text before it is replaced —
 * a region mutated and reverted within a frame or two announces nothing at all.
 * And the region has to be CLEARED rather than left standing, because two
 * identical messages in a row are one unchanged string and the second announces
 * nothing; clearing is also what stops a region from re-reading, on a remount, a
 * message the person already heard. So a full lane drains in
 * `LIVE_ANNOUNCEMENT_QUEUE_CAP` × this — seconds, not minutes.
