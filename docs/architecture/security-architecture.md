# Security Architecture

## Purpose

Define the system's trust boundaries, permission layers, and transport security posture.

## Scope

This document covers identity, membership authorization, node trust, approvals, capability grants, and transport boundaries.

## Context

The product combines multiple humans, multiple runtime nodes, and local code execution. Security depends on not collapsing those concerns into one flat trust model.

## Responsibilities

- authenticate users and authorize session membership
- distinguish participant trust from runtime-node trust
- govern tool, file, network, and execution permissions
- protect remote transport and relay paths
- preserve auditable approval and grant history

## Component Boundaries

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Identity And Session Authorization` | Authenticates users and authorizes membership in sessions. Auth methods are deployed incrementally: Device Auth Grant (RFC 8628) + password/TOTP at CLI launch, WebAuthn/Passkeys added at desktop launch, with WebAuthn becoming the recommended default for desktop users. Tokens: PASETO v4 — access tokens (v4.public, 15 min), refresh tokens (v4.local, 7 days, rotated on use). OAuth 2.1 with PKCE mandatory. DPoP sender-constraining for access tokens. |
| `Membership Policy Engine` | Determines session roles and participant capabilities. |
| `Runtime Capability Registry` | Tracks what each runtime node can expose and under what trust envelope. |
| `Approval Policy Engine` | Evaluates and records approval requests and resolutions. |
| `Transport Security Layer` | Protects local IPC, client-daemon, and relay/control-plane traffic. Local daemon: socket reachability + optional 256-bit session token (mode 0600, rotated per restart). Control plane: HTTPS/TLS. Relay: MLS (RFC 9420) group E2EE via `ts-mls` — forward secrecy, post-compromise security, zero-knowledge relay. KeyPackages distributed via control plane with Ed25519 signature verification to prevent MITM substitution. Fallback: X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305 via `@noble/curves` + `@noble/ciphers` if MLS libraries prove immature. |
| `Audit Layer` | Records grants, denials, escalations, and revocations. |

## Data Flow

1. Identity claims enter through the control plane.
2. Membership policy determines whether the participant may join and what actions are allowed.
3. Runtime nodes declare capabilities and are accepted or rejected by trust policy.
4. Runs request tool, file, or network permissions when needed.
5. Approval decisions are recorded and propagated back into the run engine.

## Trust Boundaries

- Session membership does not imply local machine trust.
- Runtime-node capability declaration does not bypass approval policy.
- The relay path must be treated as less trusted than direct local transport.
- The local daemon remains the enforcement point for local execution permissions.

## Failure Modes

- An invited participant is over-trusted and gains unintended execution capability.
- Remembered approvals outlive their intended scope and create hidden privilege drift.
- Transport authentication succeeds while local authorization policy is misapplied.
- Relay or remote-path compromise exposes data that should have remained end-to-end protected.
