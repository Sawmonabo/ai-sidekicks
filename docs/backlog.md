# Backlog

## Purpose

This file is the active development backlog for the product defined in [vision.md](./vision.md).

## How To Use This Backlog

- Add items only when they represent real remaining work.
- Link every item to the governing spec, plan, ADR, or operations doc where possible.
- Keep items outcome-oriented. A backlog item should describe a deliverable, not a vague area of concern.
- Remove or rewrite stale items instead of letting the file become a historical log.
- When work is complete, update the canonical docs it depends on first, then move the item to [Backlog Archive](./archive/backlog-archive.md).

## Status Values

- `todo`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `completed`

## Priority Values

- `P0` — blocks all implementation or blocks a critical feature
- `P1` — blocks a specific feature or must resolve before v1
- `P2` — should resolve before v1 ship

---

## Active Items

_(All V1 doc-first phase items (BL-038 through BL-097) completed 2026-04-17 → 2026-04-25 and moved to [Backlog Archive](./archive/backlog-archive.md). No active items at present; new items follow the Item Template below.)_

---

## Item Template

Use this shape for new backlog items:

```md
### BL-0XX: Short Title

- Status: `todo`
- Priority: `P1`
- Owner: `unassigned`
- References: [Relevant Spec](./specs/000-spec-template.md), [Relevant Plan](./plans/000-plan-template.md)
- Summary: One or two sentences describing the deliverable or change.
- Exit Criteria: Concrete condition that makes this item complete.
```

## Maintenance Rule

If information in a backlog item becomes durable product truth, move that information into the canonical docs and keep only the remaining work here.
