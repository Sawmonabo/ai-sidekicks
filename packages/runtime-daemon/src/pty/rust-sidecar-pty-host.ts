// Out-of-process Rust PTY sidecar implementation of the `PtyHost` contract.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
//
// Plan-024 ships two backends behind the `PtyHost` interface published
// from `@ai-sidekicks/contracts`: an in-process `node-pty` wrapper
// (Phase 2, primary on macOS/Linux, fallback on Windows) and this
// out-of-process Rust sidecar binary marshalled over Content-Length
// framing on the binary's stdio (Phase 3, primary on Windows once the
// Phase 5 selector default-flip lands). ADR-019 §Decision item 1
// names the sidecar as the structural fix for the `node-pty` ConPTY
// bug cluster (`microsoft/node-pty#904`, `microsoft/node-pty#887`,
// `microsoft/node-pty#894`, `openai/codex#13973`); the daemon-side
// surface here is the supervision + framing layer that translates
// between the `PtyHost` runtime API and the sidecar's wire envelope.
//
// What this file does
// -------------------
//
// Three load-bearing concerns:
//
//   1. `Content-Length` framing. The sidecar speaks LSP-style
//      `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n<body>` on stdin/stdout per ADR-009.
//      We build a minimal local framer here rather than reaching for
//      the contracts package's `jsonrpc-streaming.ts` (which contains
//      only subscription/notification types — confirmed via grep) OR
//      the runtime-daemon's `local-ipc-gateway.ts::parseFrame` (which
//      DOES implement the LSP grammar but is hardened for the
//      network-peer trust posture: 1024-byte header-section cap,
//      structured `FramingError.code` taxonomy, oversized-body skip-
//      and-resync). Reaching for the gateway framer here would import
//      a network-peer-grade framer onto a local-trusted-child boundary
//      — overweight surface and a bidirectional dependency we do not
//      need. The Rust side has `framing.rs`; this is its TS sibling.
//      Schema parity is hand-maintained on each side (no code-gen in
//      V1 — Plan-024 §Implementation Step 3). A future hardening pass
//      may add a header-section cap symmetric to the body cap; tracked
//      as a follow-up.
//
//   2. Crash-respawn supervision with a sliding-window budget. ADR-019
//      §Failure Mode Analysis row "Sidecar binary missing on user
//      machine" + Plan-024 §F-024-3-05 specify a "5 failures per 60s"
//      budget after which `PtyBackendUnavailable` is surfaced to the
//      consumer rather than spinning up an indefinite respawn loop.
//      The budget is implemented as a sliding window (per-crash
//      timestamp recorded; entries older than 60s evicted; window
//      contains 5+ crashes ⇒ fail). Sliding correctness avoids the
//      thrash-at-window-boundary failure mode of a fixed window.
//
//   3. The `PtyHost` contract surface. Mirrors `NodePtyHost`'s method
//      shape and lifecycle behavior so callers can swap implementations
//      via `PtyHostSelector` without behavioral drift. Spawn returns
//      a `SpawnResponse` carrying the sidecar-minted session id; subsequent
//      `resize`/`write`/`kill`/`close` route to the wire equivalents
//      and resolve once the sidecar acks.
//
// Architectural seams — `RustSidecarPtyHostDeps`
// ----------------------------------------------
//
// Every effectful primitive — the sidecar binary path resolver, the
// `child_process.spawn` invocation, the timer used by the crash-budget
// window, the clock used to stamp crash entries — is reachable through
// an injectable `Deps` record. Production callers pass nothing
// (defaults wire to `child_process.spawn`, `process.hrtime.bigint`,
// real `setTimeout`); tests inject `vi.fn()` doubles so the supervisor
// can be exercised without a real binary, real OS-level processes, or
// wall-clock waits. Mirrors the `NodePtyHostDeps` pattern from
// T-024-2-2.

/**
 * Typed error surfaced when the sidecar emits a frame whose body the

 * land here, distinguished by `decodeCause`:
 *
 *   - `"json-parse"`: `JSON.parse` threw — the bytes are not valid JSON
 *     (e.g., truncated payload, non-UTF-8 garbage). This is the
 *     framing-equivalent failure at the payload layer: the framer
 *     handed us a body it considered well-formed at the wire level,
 *     but the body's JSON-decoding contract is broken.
 *
 *   - `"non-object-envelope"`: `JSON.parse` succeeded but returned a
 *     value that is not a plain non-array object (e.g., `null`, a
 *     primitive like `42`, an array — anything that does not satisfy
 *     the discriminated-union shape of `Envelope`). Without these
 *     guards a `null` body would slip past the try/catch and hit a
 *     `TypeError` on the downstream `envelope.kind` access, and an
 *     array body would silently fall through the switch (arrays have
 *     no `.kind`, and `typeof [] === "object"` so the typeof check
 *     alone is insufficient); we intercept all three shapes here so
 *     the teardown shape is symmetric with the parse-throw case.
 *
 *   - `"unknown-kind"`: `JSON.parse` succeeded and yielded a non-array
 *     object whose `kind` discriminator does NOT match any compile-time
 *     `Envelope` variant (version-skew between daemon and sidecar, or a
 *     sidecar bug emitting a kind the daemon's contract does not know).
 *     Structurally similar to `"non-object-envelope"` (payload-contract
 *     violation at the JSON-decoded layer) but the JSON is well-formed
 *     at the object level — the failure is purely in the discriminator.
 *     Silent fall-through here would leave any queued outstanding-Promise
 *     hanging indefinitely (the response that would have arrived in this
 *     frame is gone, and no case-arm resolver can route it); treat as a
 *     fatal supervisor event symmetric with the other two paths.
 *
 * Mirrors `PtyBackendUnavailableError`'s pattern (typed-class wrapper
 * around a structured failure). Daemon-internal callers `instanceof`
 * this to surface the JSON-decode-specific rejection cause to consumers
 * awaiting a request that would have arrived in the corrupted frame.
 *
 * Field name `decodeCause` (not `cause`) avoids overriding the built-in
 * `Error.cause` slot from ES2022 — different semantic (the standard
 * `cause` chains errors with another `Error`/`unknown`; our field is a
 * compile-time string discriminator).

/**
 * Four-tier sidecar binary resolver per Plan-024 §F-024-3-03.
 *
 * Resolution order — first hit wins; later tiers are NOT consulted:
 *
 *   1. Env-var `AIS_PTY_SIDECAR_BIN` (absolute path; trumps everything;
 *      lets developers point at a hand-built binary; CI custom-path
 *      overrides). Relative paths are REJECTED — a relative path would
 *      couple resolution to `process.cwd()` which is caller-dependent
 *      (a daemon spawned with cwd=/ vs cwd=/Users/x sees different
 *      binaries; that surface is a footgun, not a feature).
 *
 *   2. `require.resolve('@ai-sidekicks/pty-sidecar-${platform}-${arch}/
 *      bin/sidecar')` — the published platform package shipped to end
 *      users via `npm install`. This is the production V1 path; the
 *      umbrella `@ai-sidekicks/pty-sidecar` meta-package's
 *      `optionalDependencies` selects the right platform sub-package
 *      via `os` + `cpu` constraints.
 *
 *   3. `packages/sidecar-rust-pty/target/release/sidecar` — workspace
 *      dev-build, release profile. Used when a contributor has run
 *      `cargo build --release` locally but has NOT installed the
 *      published packages (the typical inner-loop dev workflow once a
 *      release-quality binary is desired).
 *
 *   4. `packages/sidecar-rust-pty/target/debug/sidecar` — workspace
 *      dev-build, debug profile, last resort. Used during initial
 *      iteration when a contributor has only run `cargo build` (the
 *      default debug profile is faster to compile but slower to run).
 *
 * On all four exhausted, throws `PtyBackendUnavailableError` per Plan-
 * 024 §F-024-3-02 + ADR-019 §Failure Mode "Sidecar binary missing on
 * user machine"; the daemon-layer caller (`PtyHostSelector`) converts
 * the throw to a `PtyBackendUnavailable` wire payload that downstream
 * UIs render as the "no PTY backend available" diagnostic banner.
 *
 * **Path-resolution anchor.** Tier 3/4 paths are resolved relative to
 * THIS file's location via `import.meta.url`, NOT `process.cwd()`. The
 * file lives at `packages/runtime-daemon/src/pty/rust-sidecar-pty-host.ts`
 * during dev (`vitest`-loaded `src/`) and at
 * `packages/runtime-daemon/dist/pty/rust-sidecar-pty-host.js` post-build
 * (`tsc`-emitted `dist/`); both layouts are exactly four directory levels
 * below `packages/`, so `../../../sidecar-rust-pty/target/...` is correct
 * from either. `process.cwd()` would be caller-dependent (the daemon
 * could be spawned from any directory) — same footgun as the relative-
 * env-var case.
 *
 * **Windows `.exe` suffix.** F-024-3-03's spec text reads `target/
 * release/sidecar` literally, but ADR-019 §Decision item 1 names
 * Windows as the primary target — the actual built binary is
 * `sidecar.exe` on Windows. We probe `${name}.exe` on `process.platform
 * === "win32"` and `${name}` elsewhere. Without the suffix the
 * resolver would deterministically miss tiers 2/3/4 on Windows even
 * when the binary exists on disk — defeats the entire failure-mode
 * mitigation on the platform that needs it most.
 *
 * **Effectful primitives are injectable.** `env`, `nodeRequire`, and
 * `existsSync` are constructor-injected with production defaults
 * (`process.env`, `module.createRequire(import.meta.url)`,
 * `node:fs.existsSync`). Tests pass `vi.fn()` doubles and assert tier
 * ordering by counting calls — when tier 1 hits, the `nodeRequire`
 * mock has zero invocations.
 *
 * Bracket notation on `process.env` is required by this repo's tsconfig
