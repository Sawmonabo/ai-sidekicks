// Codex driver — app-server transport + the five lifecycle operations (Plan-005
// Phase 3, T3.1).
//
// This module owns TWO layers that deliberately live in one file:
//   1. `CodexAppServerConnection` — the JSONL/JSON-RPC transport over a single
//      `PtyHost` session (framing, request correlation, deadlines, teardown).
//   2. `CodexLifecycleManager` — the five lifecycle operations expressed in
//      Codex `app-server` method calls (`createSession`, `resumeSession`,
//      `startRun`, `interruptRun`, `closeSession`).
//
// They are NOT split behind a transport port. The transport is not swappable at
// this task (T3.15 leg 6 introduces `DriverTransportConfig` selection), and the
// unit tests drive the REAL framing code through a fake `PtyHost` — a port would
// let the framing go untested behind a stub, which is the failure mode that
// matters here (see the MAX_CANON note below for why framing is load-bearing).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The termios prelude — why the spawn command is `/bin/sh -c`, not the binary
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The substrate this driver is required to consume is `PtyHost` (Plan-024), and
// a PTY slave starts in CANONICAL mode with ECHO on. `codex app-server` is not a
// TUI and never calls `tcsetattr`, so nothing turns them off. Both defaults are
// fatal to a line-delimited protocol:
//
//   * MAX_CANON — in canonical mode the line discipline caps a single input line
//     (Darwin: 1024 bytes). A longer line is DISCARDED SILENTLY: no error, no
//     short read, no response, ever. Measured against `codex-cli 0.149.1` on
//     Darwin 25.6.0: a 1015-byte frame is answered, a 1045-byte frame is not, and
//     nothing above it ever is. Splitting one frame across several small writes
//     does NOT evade the cap (the limit is per line, not per write) and in
//     practice performs strictly worse. Any real `turn/start` exceeds 1024 bytes,
//     so an unconfigured PTY cannot carry this protocol at all.
//   * ECHO — written frames are echoed back on the read side, so the reader sees
//     its own requests interleaved with server output.
//
// Both are removed by configuring the tty before the server starts. The prelude
// runs `stty` on the pty slave (its own stdin), announces readiness, and then
// `exec`s the provider binary so the shell is REPLACED — the child that `PtyHost`
// signals and reaps is the provider itself, with no shell left in the tree.
//
// Three properties of the command string are load-bearing:
//   * `&&`, not `;` — if `stty` fails, the prelude aborts and the sentinel never
//     arrives, so the caller gets a typed startup failure. With `;` the server
//     would start in canonical mode and silently swallow every large frame,
//     which is a far worse failure than refusing to start.
//   * the sentinel — writing before the prelude has run would race it, and those
//     early writes ARE echoed (verified). Waiting for the sentinel closes the
//     race deterministically rather than tolerating it. The echo filter below is
//     retained anyway as defense in depth, not as the primary mechanism.
//   * the binary path travels in the ENV ARRAY (`CODEX_APP_SERVER_BIN`), never
//     interpolated into the shell string — so a path can never become shell
//     syntax, and the "env is exactly what the caller supplied" property holds.
//
// POSIX-only. ADR-019 puts Windows on a Rust PTY sidecar; that platform needs an
// equivalent termios step (or a non-PTY transport) before this driver runs there.
// That is a T3.15 leg-6 concern, not a silent assumption of this module.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// I-005-5 — resume failure NEVER becomes a new session
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `resumeSession` catches every failure of the resume path and converts it into
// the typed `{ status: 'failed', recoveryCondition: 'recovery-needed', ... }`
// result. It contains NO call to `createSession`, no `thread/start` write, and no
// fallback that could manufacture a fresh thread. Escalation is the daemon's
// decision, made on an explicit condition — never the driver's, made silently.
//
// The typed result is produced through `DriverResumeResultSchema.parse`, so the
// shape is mechanically enforced rather than asserted. That parse is preceded by
// `normalizeProviderFailureDetail`, because the schema's `wireFreeFormString`
// REJECTS empty, whitespace-only, NUL-bearing, and overlength strings — a
// provider error with a blank message would otherwise turn the typed failure back
// into a thrown exception, which is exactly the loss this invariant forbids.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Error vocabulary
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Only codes already registered in `docs/architecture/contracts/error-contracts.md §Driver` are used:
// `driver.unavailable` (503) for transport/process failures and `driver.timeout`
// (504) for a deadline. Provider-reported request errors and malformed driver
// config carry NO dotted code by design — classifying provider failures beyond
// transport errors is T3.14/T3.22's leg, and minting a code here would add an
// unregistered row to that census.
//
// Spec coverage: `Spec-005 §Required Behavior` (the normalized driver contract's
// lifecycle surface); `Spec-005 §Fallback Behavior` (a failed resume handle
// surfaces a recovery-needed condition — AC3).
//
// Refs: Plan-005 §Phase 3 / T3.1, `Spec-005 §Required Behavior`,
// `Spec-005 §Fallback Behavior`, invariant I-005-5, ADR-011, ADR-019,
